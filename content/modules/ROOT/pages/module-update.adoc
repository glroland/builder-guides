== Goals of this lab

As an AI model builder at Parasol, you are responsible for the rollout of new versions of AI models when updates are needed to address quality or performance issues.. In this exercise, we will emphasize the importance of regularly updating AI models in production to ensure they remain effective, accurate, and aligned with Parasolâ€™s evolving business needs. Regular updates help mitigate model drift, incorporate new data, and enhance functionality. This exercise will teach you how to roll out these updates efficiently and safely using OpenShift AI. You will start by deploying the original trained Parasol model, then deploying a different, updated model. By configuring OpenShift AI for a canary rollout via KServe, you will direct 10% of the traffic to the new model while keeping 90% on the old, allowing for gradual integration and load balancing. You'll repeat prompts to observe the load distribution, then shift traffic entirely to the new model. Finally, you'll confirm the new model's deployment and deactivate the old one. This hands-on practice will equip you with the skills to manage model updates seamlessly, ensuring minimal disruption and maximum performance.
